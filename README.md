# Personal---Ham-Radio-SATCOM

This is a personal project I like to have fun with in my free time. I'm a general-class liscensed amateur radio operator, but I think I've had most of my fun trying to chase weather satellites overhead (if I'm not trying to make contacts on the ISS repeater). Below are some pictures of the collapsable hybrid Moxon-Yagi antenna I built to do this with, full credit to [Craig Bowman](https://gitlab.com/cbowman/uv-moxon-yagi-antenna) for the design - I just followed his instructions to build it.

Pictures were recieved using an RTL-SDR dongle (no amplifiers or filters used) and SDR++ and SatDump to record and decode the transmissions.
